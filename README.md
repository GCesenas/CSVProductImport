# üì¶ CSVProductImport

This Laravel command-line tool allows importing product data from a CSV file into a MySQL database. It validates and processes data with customizable business rules, skipping invalid or duplicate entries.

## ‚ú® Features

- Validates CSV file structure and content.
- Automatically detects CSV delimiter.
- Handles different file encodings and normalizes line endings.
- Allows importing data in a test mode without database insertion.
- Skips products with invalid or duplicate information.
- Provides detailed feedback during the import process.

## üîß Requirements

- PHP 8.x
- Composer
- MySQL database
- Laravel 9.x or later

## üíª Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GCesenas/CSVProductImport.git
   cd CSVProductImport
   
2. Install the dependencies:

     ```bash
    composer install

3. Set up the .env file:
Copy .env.example to .env and update the database credentials:

    cp .env.example .env

4. Run the database migrations:

     ```bash
    php artisan migrate

This will create the required table (tblProductData) in your database.

## ‚ö° Usage

### Importing Product data

To import data from a CSV file, use the following command:

    php artisan import:product-data --file=stock.csv

Make sure the CSV file has the required headers: Product Code, Product Name, Product Description, Stock, Cost in GBP, Discontinued.

### Running in Test Mode

You can run the import in test mode to see what would happen without actually inserting data into the database:

    php artisan import:product-data --file=stock.csv --test

In test mode, the command will process the data, but no records will be inserted into the database.

### Sample CSV File

Your CSV file should have the following structure:

    Product Code,Product Name,Product Description,Stock,Cost in GBP,Discontinued
    P0011,TV,High-definition television,15,499.99,no
    P0012,CD Player,High-quality CD player,10,99.99,no
    P0013,VCR,VHS player,5,29.99,yes

## ‚úîÔ∏è Testing

### Running Unit and Feature Tests

The project includes unit and feature tests to ensure the correct behavior of the import functionality.

To run all tests:

    php artisan test

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods like cleanPrice, cleanStock, and detectDelimiter.

- **Feature Tests**: Test the complete import process, including valid data imports, handling of invalid rows, and detection of duplicates.

## üìà Example Output

    php artisan import:product-data --file=stock.csv

    Importing data...
    Imported product: TV
    Imported product: CD Player
    Skipped product due to duplicate code: TV
    Skipped product due to excessive length in product name: Ultra-long product name
    Import complete. Processed: 5, Imported: 2, Skipped: 3
    The following errors occurred during the import:
    Skipped row due to column mismatch: P0011, Misc Cables, error   in export

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

- **CSV File Not Found**: Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists.
- **Database Errors**: Check your .env database configuration if you encounter connection issues.
- **Encoding Issues**: The script automatically detects and converts file encoding to UTF-8, but ensure your CSV is in a supported format.
